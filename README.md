# Install requirements.txt (For some reason i had some issues not finding the dependency so i had to use the command below)
    pip install -r requirements.txt 


# 👇️ Install dependency
    python -m pip install requests



# How to run manage-tasks
    - python main.py --search 'Luke'
    - python main.py --search 'Vader' --world
    - python main.py --virtualize
    - python main.py --clean

Regarding the visualization, i created a linear request/time graph where if the request
is successful(find the character) it gets green , otherwise it gets red.
